## Overview
### Description
[WIP]: App where you can add ingredients into app and get recipe recommendations using those ingredients.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Cooking
- **Mobile:** This app would primarily be for mobile but would perhaps be equally viable as a website able to be used on a computer, as people could sign in and see their ingredients/recipes from their computers.
- **Story:** Allows people to keep track of the food they are purchasing while suggesting ideas for recipes based on the provided ingredients and user preferences
- **Market:** Any person who might like to know what recipes they could make using the ingredients they have on hand
- **Habit:** People will use this app at every mealtime and possibly while grocery shopping if a recipe they found requires an ingredient they didn't have
- **Scope:** First, the app will center around suggesting recipes based on entered ingredients. User preferences will also likely be taken into account (cuisine, time limit). Then, discovering new recipes (possibly based on interests) and being able to save them, add ingredients to shopping list, and share with friends may be added [WIP].
